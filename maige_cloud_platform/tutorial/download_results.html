<h2> Inspect the results using ROIEditor </h2>
<font color="aliceblue">
The segmentation results can be inspected by using our ROIEditor that is available in <a href="http://www.mristudio.org/">www.mristudio.org</a>.<br><br> Both the native and MNI-space data can be used for the inspection purpose, but the MNI space would be more convenient because all images have the same position, orientation, and the number of slices. In addition, all segmentation in our pipeline is performed in the MNI space, which is linearly back-transferred to the native space. This transfer of the segmentation makes the appearance of the segmentation jagged in the native space. Therefore, it is recommended to use the image in the normalized (MNI) space.
<br><br>
All data are in Analyze format.

<h2> Our segmentation results are not perfect </h2>
<br>
<font color="aliceblue">
Currently, we are beta-testing our pipeline with only two types of atlases (adult and pediatric), each contains10 or 11 multiple reference atlases. While they provide segmentation results with high quality, sometimes failure occurs. While we are working on more comprehensive atlas sets, any failure reports are highly appreciated for us to understand the pattern of failures. Below, several common errors are listed, which can be readily corrected by RoiEditor. In any case, all segmentation results should be inspected by RoiEditor

<h2> "View Result" for online visualization</h2>

This option brings you to the "BrainKnowledge" interface, in which the segmentation results can be inspected in the MNI space directly through the web-interface. Unlike RoiEditor, the data need not to be downloaded for visualization. The disadvantage is that it does not provide the ROI-editing capability. However, it has several unique functions to analyze the anatomical features of individual subjects compared to population data (single subject vs population data).
